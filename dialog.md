# Merry widow

## Act 1

CAMILLE Very well.  I’ll do my best.

VAL no immediate hurry.

 (Danilo enters..  Top hat, stick, gloves etc.)

*DANILO Well here I am.  Where’s the Fatherland?*

NJEGUS I shall at once announce your arrival to his Excellency.

*DANILO Give me time.  Give me time.*  

NJEGUS Very well, Count Danilovitch..

 (Song – I’m off to Chez Maxime)

*DANILO Njegus, my adored one.  Where’s our revered ambassador?  Under the table?*

NJEGUS By your leave, he’s  deep in conversation with Madame Glawari.

*DANILO Madame Gla.......?  So she’s here, is she?  Tell me Njegus, what’s this supreme service my Fatherland desires of me – at midnight, too -  and here of all places?*

NJEGUS The Baron said something about earning a few millions.

*DANILO Did he indeed!  I’m just the man for spending them.  Earning isn’t  my line.  Never was.  Goodbye.*

NJEGUS No. No!  Don’t go.

*DANILO Then I’ll stay and sleep.  I need it.  .*

NJEGUS Very well.  I’ll announce you a little later.

*DANILO Good.  Isn’t there a quiet corner where a man can snooze?*

NJEGUS Certainly.   Come this way.

*DANILO Give me four hours. Lolo,-Dodo- Jou jou.*

CAMILLE Listen, Valencienne.  

---

HANNA Gentlemen, please.    You must grant me a moment’s peace – then I’ll be yours again.  I promise you.

 (They melt away reluctantly.  Hannah mops her brow, sits and fans under her arms.  The room is filled with a reverberating snore from within the ante room.)

HANNA What on earth was that?

 (Another snore makes her move over to the door.  )

*DANILO Hanna!*

HANNA You had better get back to your snoring.  But try not to make such a disgraceful racket one can hardly hear the band.

*DANILO Please!....I am awake now.  Was I really snoring?*

HANNA like a grampus.

*DANILO how monstrous of me.  So you are living in Paris?*

HANNA I thought I’d try to catch up with some of the things I’ve missed – enjoy myself a little – then settle down.  Perhaps even marry .......

*DANILO What again?  I’ve always imagined that was the sort of dam’ fool thing a sensible girl only did once.* 

HANNA If you had remained in my life.  I don’t suppose I would have done it at all. Now isn’t that true.

*DANILO Hanna – sorry.  I mean madam – if I had stayed at least you wouldn’t be the widow of the sainted Mr. Glawari.  As a matter of fact you would be the spouse of a blissful Danilo and you know it.*

HANNA And yet I seem to remember your noble Uncle refusing to let his aristocratic nephew give   his oh so aristocratic name to the daughter of a tenant farmer.  Both Uncle and nephew I remember perfectly, thank you, and with a fair amount of disgust.

*DANILO  I see you haven’t exactly broken your heart over me.  .*

HANNA My dear Danilo –

*DANILO oh I know what you want to say.  Your father had a great many debts, and you married to save him.* 

HANNA The reasons for my marriage are nobodys business but mine....  however now that I am a wealthy widow, I suppose.....

*DANILO Yes?  You suppose?*

HANNA I suppose your aristocratic uncle would no longer have the slightest objection if his precious nephew were to do me the honour of offering me his hand in matrimony.

*DANILO HAnna – I mean Madame!  Do you honestly think for one moment that your fifteen million –*

HANNA Twenty

*DANILO  You don’t know me at all.  That’s all I can say.*

HANNA All you can say doesn’t amount to much my dear Count -  All men are the same.  If  they  say to me ’ I Iove you,’  do you imagine its me they’re after?  Don’t you believe it.

*DANILO Nonsense*

HANNA I can prove it.

*DANILO Can you?  I wonder.*

  (Song – All’s one to all men where there’s gold.)

HANNA So now you know!  And you have sworn never to say it.

*DANILO I have.*  

HANNA Danilo

*DANILO How clever of you to remember my name.*

HANNA You’re running away.  Is that because you’re afraid to let a forbidden word slip out?

*DANILO I’m afraid of nothing madam.*

HANNA So it’s a declaration of war.

*DANILO You take the words out of my mouth.  (Anna drops a glove)*  

*DANILO Aha!  Throwing down the gauntlet eh Madame Glawari?*

HANNA Just that,Count Danilovitch. 

 (Both exit.  )

---

ZETA Indeed no.     It had best be delivered by me.

 Ah there you are at last my dear Count.

*DANILO your Excellency – Baroness.*

ZETA  Forgive me Valencienne.  (to Danilo)  I  have important business for you.  De Rossillion I’m sure will do my wife the honour of conducting her back to her guests.

CAMILLE The pleasure is mine – as always.

ZETA Let me see, how long have you been with us at the embassy?

*DANILO Too long.  Four months.*

ZETA And what exactly have you been doing?

*DANILO Exactly nothing.*

ZETA Splendid.  What?

*DANILO I  seem to have no  aptitude for work.*

DANIO  - of any kind.  I have no bent for it. 

ZETA In your leisure hours, now I suppose you have affairs of the heart.

*DANILO Could you name any occupation more pleasant?*

ZETA But these affairs – I gather they have not left you what you would call – well off?-

*DANILO I’m broke.  You’d never believe how much money can go through a woman’s hands.*

ZETA How true.    Now look here.  You understand women I think.

*DANILO Certainly not.  Who does?*

ZETA But you know them.

*DANILO Intimately.* 

ZETA So.  I have a delicate mission to propose.

*DANILO No work please.*  

ZETA Not work, dear Count but pleasure.

*DANILO Pleasure?  Go on.*

ZETA You will have to marry.

*DANILO Marry!! I distinctly heard you say something about pleasure.*

ZETA The Fatherland expects it of you.

*DANILO What is this?  An Embassy or a marriage bureau?  Who’s the happy bride?*

ZETA Well – ahem – a very great deal of money.

ZETA It’s Madam Glawari.

*DANILO NEVER!  I’ll make any other woman happy – as a sacrifice for my country.  But her?  No.  Let us change the subject.* 

ZETA Think carefully Danilovitch.  Madam Galwari may go and marry a Parisian.  What happens then?  Our beloved country is deprived of twenty millions.  We need that money. .  We are desperate.

*DANILO Well, if it’s only a foreign marriage you’re afraid of – I think I can prevent that from happening.*

ZETA You could? How?

*DANILO Simply by removing – from the neighbourhood of Madam Glawari – any foreigner who shows the slightest sign of suspicious intention.  You know, that glint in the eye!*

ZETA Indeed I do.  You must exert your influence, so that Madam Galwari marries no one but a Pontevedrian.  Preferably yourself.

ZETA Oh no!

*DANILO  I stick to the principle – Love whom you will – make few proposals – never be wed.*

 (Offstage cries of “ladies choice”)

ZETA There you are.  Ladies choice.  And here comes the widow.

*DANILO Agreed your Excellency.  The great removal campaign will now commence.*

ZEAT The Fatherland will be greatly in your debt.

*DANILO Well that will be a change.*

 (Song – Finale 1)

## Act 2

ZETA But you pointed out his attendance here was a duty  – an official trip – for the Fatherland.

NJEGUS  Wild horses wouldn’t drag him here he said.

ZETA This is an outrage.

* (DANILO enters wearing the smartest uniform of a Pontevedrian calvary Officer) *

*DANILO My dear Baron –* 

ZETA But here he is –

*DANILO Don’t be alarmed!  My removal operations have been indefatigable.*

ZETA And conspicuously unsuccessful.

ZETA I don’t believe you even know the name of the man who is the real threat to my plan –

*DANILO Who?*

ZETA I suppose De Rosillon.

*DANILO Caille?  I don’t believe it.*

NJEGUS Neither do I.

ZETA Why not?  He’s the best looking man in Paris – and the best dressed and the worst off.  De Rosillon’s our danger spot, you mark my words. 

NJEGUS But I happen to know he’s already madly in love with a married woman your Excellency.

ZETA What – who is she?

NJEGUS Well – ah – I can’t say he has actually told me.

*DANILO What’s  the poor woman’s husband going to say to all this?*

ZETA The husband?  I shall deal with him personally.  Obviously the man’s an ass.    Oh look –there is de Rosillion – with my wife.  What luck!  She has some influence over him.

ZETA She must get de Rousillon to renounce his infatuation for Madame Glawari and then wed the married woman he really loves.  That shouldn’t be too difficult.

NJEGUS Oh no.  Quite simple.

ZETA Run and ask my wife to be so good as to wait for me.  Say I must speak with her..

NJEGUS Certainly your Excellency.

ZETA What’s your theory about all this?

*DANILO I’m foxed.. But there’s always Olga Kromow.*

ZETA Kromow!!  Ah perhaps this fan might help you to a clue.  It belongs to Madam Kromow – or at least I think it does.  It has got “I love you”  written on it.  Look.

*DANILO So it has.  Large as life.  And it’s Camille’s hand writing.  We are getting hot!*

ZETA We are, dear Count, we are.   I leave it in your diplomatic hands.  I shall expect results.

*DANILO Camille, .... Camille de Rosillion.  But who’s the lady friend?  Olga?  I doubt it.*  

HANNA Count Danilovitch.  What a surprise.  You’ve been avoiding me, why?

*DANILO Military tactics   Madame Glawari.*

*DANILO Only light skirmishes so far.  The heavy artillery will follow.*

ANNA Must it?  Quarreling is such a tiresome occupation.

*DANILO I’m not quarrelling – I’m just avoiding you.*

HANNA You didn’t avoid me once.  Remember our drives out in the farm?

*DANILO They were my undoing.  Never again.*

HANNA There are still plenty of one horse gigs in Paris.

*DANILO Too risky.*

HANNA Not even brave enough to take the tiniest little risk?

HANNA And there’s still a lot of Paris i haven’t seen you know.

 (SONG – Jogging in a one horse gig.)

NJEGUS Charming woman.

*DANILO You think so?*

NJEGUS What were you doing, may I ask?

*DANILO Deciding not to go with her.*

. (Ladies voices are heard offstage)

*DANILO Now for a diplomatic coup.  Njegus.*

NJEGUS Yessir

*DANILO Take a pencil.*

NJEGUS Yessir..

*DANILO Notebook.*

NJEGUS Yessir.

*DANILO Stand by and stand back.*

NJEGUS Yessir

*DANILO Madame?*

OLGA Count?

*DANILO I think you have lost something.*

OLGA I don’t think so.

*DANILO Ah but you have.  Your heart and also another little – shall we say –trinket?*

OLGA What do you mean?

*DANILO It’s her!  I’ve found her!  You can rely on me in all manner of discretion.  But may I give you a slight warning?  He is on the point of marrying someone else – in fact the widow.*

OLGA Who/  St. Brioche?

*DANILO What?*

OLGA Oh who? What? Thank you dear Count...Oh dear.

*DANILO It isn’t her after all.  Put down Olga Kromow and St. Brioche.  Here comes Madame Bogdanowitch.  We’ll see if the fan is hers.. Madame – has lost something I think.*

SYLVANE Surely not.

*DANILO I think I’m correct.  It is your heart Madame and also something else – something you can roll up.*

SYLVANE Something I can roll up?

*DANILO It could be her.  Set your mind at rest.  I can be trusted with a ladys confidence.  But allow me to give you a piece of timely advice.*  
Abandon him – he is about to marry the widow.

SYLVANE Cascada?

*DANILO Cascada*

SYLVANE Thank you – thank you dear Count.  Oh dear.

*DANILO  Njegus.   Madame Sylvane and Cascada.*  

NJEGUS Got it.  Next please.

*DANILO This is certainly Camille’s writing. Then who the devil is the lady?  Well, I’m narrowing it down.*

PRASKOWIA Danilo.   What a be-ootiful fan.

*DANILO  Ah Madame Praskowia, it is indeed a beautiful thing. Chinese would you say?  On it is written, you will observe, “I love you”. *

PRASKOWIA Oh.

*DANILO May I place it in the dainty hand of the owner?*

PRASKOWIA At last.

*DANILO Njegus, stand by.  This is it.*

PRASKOWIA Dear Count.  Did you guess or did you know?

*DANILO  Ah dear Madame, Know what?*

PRASKOWIA How near and dear to me you are.

*DANILO  Njegus – help.*

NJEGUS Forgive me Madame – your husband-

PRASKOWIA Where?

NJEGUS Coming this way.

PRASKOWIA Oh I may count on your discretion?

*DANILO For ever amen.   But whose is this confounded fan?*

NJEGUS What shall I do with all this information Sir?

*DANILO Send it in the diplomatic bag to London.  The foreign Office there needs some entertainment.*

CASCADA I warn you St. Brioche, you had better leave the widow alone.  I’m a dangerous swordsman.

ST. BRIOCHE And I’m a crack shot.

*DANILO (to Njegus)   Let me have your notes.  (Njegus hands notes to Danilo)*

 Now go my dear boy.  It may be dangerous around here.  (Njegus goes)

 (To Cascada and St. Brioche)    Ah gentlemen, spoiling for a tiff?  As it happens Monsieur Cascada, I’ve been meaning to have a few words with Madame Glawari about you.

CASCADA About me?

*DANILO (To St. Brioche)    And you too sir.  I feel obliged to inform her that very probably a duel  will be fought this evening between the Viscomte  and... (softly to Cascada)    Bogdanowitsch.*

CASCADA Bogdanowitsch!

*DANILO He has found out all about you and his wife.*

CASCADA Good heavens – no 

(He paces up and down.  St. Brioche is highly delighted at the spectacle of Cascada’s discomfort.).

*DANILO And M. St. Brioche I feel impelled to inform Madame Glawari that the chances are that a duel is to be fought this evening between you and -  Excuse me, sir.  n Alexis Kromow.*

ST. BRIOCHE Kromow!

*DANILO He has found out all about you and his wife.*

ST. BRIOCHE Aaaaaargh!

*DANILO Ah,  Kromow, Bogdanowitsch.* 

*DANILO I was just discussing a little domestic problem with these two friends of mine.  How should  a man behave on discovering that his wife is indulging in a – how shall I say it – a little flutter.*

KROMOW Simple enough I should have thought.

*DANILO Really.  What’s your view?*

KROMOW As far as I’m concerned the rascal should be shot.

BOGDANOWITSCH Shot and the turned into mincemeat.

CASCADA Shot?.

ST. BRIOCHE Mincemeat?

 (Both simultaneously snatch visiting cards from their pockets and write a message.  They give cards to Footmen exclaiming “Please deliver this card to Madame  Glawari and say flowers will follow.”) 

ZETA Well   gentlemen and what are you debating so hotly?

*DANILO Relations with women, your Excellency.*

ZETA Ah very complicated.

KROMOW And what a husband should do if his wife takes a lover.

ZETA Ah!  Thank God i haven’t got to worry about anything of that sort.

 (Song – You’re back where you first began)

HANNA Count Danilovitsch, what have you been up to?  You’re driving my guests away.  (She produces 2 visiting cards)

 Monsieur St. Brioche and Vicomte Cascada send me their apologies and say that they must leave at once.

*DANILO Strange*

HANNA Why are you grinning like a demented Cheshire cat?

*DANILO I feel I’ve won this round.*

HANNA On the contrary.  You have succeeded in removing the two that were the least dangerous.  There are others.

*DANILO Others?  Are there?*

HANNA May I ask why you are going to all this trouble especially A a you are not yourself in love with me –

*DANILO Oh quite out of the question.*  

HANNA Please let me finish.  I do hope I may have the benefit of your advice.

*DANILO Advice?*

HANNA As  to whether or not I should marry someone whose proposal I’m seriously considering.  It is of course, someone that I admit I want to marry.

*DANILO Very well then – marry him.  If you really want him so much.  That’s my advice.  Go and marry whoever you want.  This does not touch or hurt me.  – Damn this fan.*

HANNA No need to shout and scream.

*DANILO That’s just it.*

HANNA I understand

*DANILO So you needn’t look so proud of yourself HAnna Glawari..*

HANNA I hate you.

 (Melodrama and dancing scene during which ANNA picks up the fan and says:-

 A lady’s fan .  What’s this?  “I love you” – Who can it be meant for?  But of course it’s for me.  He wrote it down – and put the fan there – for me to find.  But he has got to say it to me.) 

HANNA Well, have you cooled down?

*DANILO What do you mean?  I wasn’t upset.*

HANNA No?  Then if you’re quite in control of yourself, I can safely tell you something.  I have finally decided to become a Parisienne.

HANNA But before settling down to married life i should to get out a little.  Take me somewhere exciting.

*DANILO At Maxime’s once again,  I swim in pink champagne*

HANNA Maxime’s.

*DANILO I must explain.  At Maxime’s there will be excellent dancing by young ladies of very doubtful reputation.  And when you enter on my arm everyone will think “Aha, the new Grisette.  What a peach!”  And monocles will flash, and I’ll be the target of envious glances.  The band strikes up a waltz.  Three bars – no more – and you’ve abandoned three  of your principles.  Carried away by the music, you fly into the arms of one man after another; and before you know where you are you will find yourself in the embraces of a madly attractive waiter.  Of course he will introduce himself – “I am the Grand Duke of Bryansk.    But you are not impressed.  Disgruntled, he bows, and retreats.*  

HANNA He has certainly danced with me.   But what has he said – nothing at all.

*DANILO Well that’s how it is.  So what do we do now?*

HANNA It’s up to you sir.

*DANILO Very well, the Moulin Rouge!*

HANNA And what do we do there?

*DANILO Dance of course.*

ZETA Njegus, listen to this.  I have asked my wife to spy on Camille de Rosillion.  And she has consented.  You see I know how to get things done..  And there they are.  Both of them.  How she flirts and gazes into his eyes.  Ha ha.. Splendid woman, exemplary wife.  

NJEGUS  (letter) An express letter for your Excellency.

ZETA From the ministry.  It’s in code.  Decode it. 

NJEGUS The Ministry

NJEGUS  Would be obliged

NJEGUS  for your promptest –

NJEGUS  reply-

NJEGUS  Regarding

NJEGUS the twenty-

ZETA Melons.  

*DANILO Millions*

---

NJEGUS First let them out – then lock it.

ZETA Ah Count.  Just in time for the denoucement.  I have traced Rosillion’s lady.

*DANILO Who is she?*

ZETA  I don’t exactly know yet.  But she’s in the pavilion  Come over here  we will now do a little eves dropping.  I can hear him talking.

*DANILO And the lady?*

ZETA I’ll have a peep?

ZETA Oh dear. I can’t see her face.  She’s standing back to the key hole.  What’s the betting it’s the good lady wife of that pompous ass Kromow?  Now she’s turning round. 

 (NJEGUS appears from the back, wringing his hands in desperation.  He beckons wildly to the right and Hannah appears.  They whisper then both go out of sight behind the pavilion)

*DANILO Well, what’s the verdict?*

 (ZETA groans, covers his face and staggers downstage to a chair)

*DANILO Come on your Excellency, Who is it?*

ZETA Don’t look!  I forbid it.  Do you hear?

*DANILO But what’s happened?  Who is it?*

ZETA My wife!

*DANILO Your – what?*

ZETA It isn’t Kromow who’s the stupid old ass.

*DANILO So she was Camille’s lover.  Your Excellency,*

ZETA Consolation?

*DANILO You are suffering for the Fatherland.*

ZETA Bugger the Fatherland!!

*DANILO I agree with you entirely.*

ZETA Open up, open up.

 (Song Finale ii)  

ZETA Ha!

*DANILO Ha!*

ZETA & DAN Ha!

HANNA I wonder what it is they want?

*DANILO Ha!  Anna and Camille*

ZETA I know for certain that I saw –

*DANILO Ha!  Anna and Camille!  This thing’s impossible.  The blackest day of my life.*

ZETA Then where on earth’s my wife.

VAL You want me?

ZETA Well this knocks me flat.

VAL What’s happened?  Someone tell me that.

*DANILO Ha!  Anna and Camille!*

CAMILLE For heaven’s sake keep still.

ZETA i saw a woman plainly standing there, When I was peeping thro’ the door

HANNA A most uncivil thing to do.

*DANILO Rather useful though.*

ZETA What’s more, I plainly heard that gentleman who stands before me – declare his love.

HANNA You heard him declare his love for me.

*DANILO Ha!  Anna.*

ZETA I could have sworn it was mu faithless wife.

HANNA My darling Camille, you must bear me out.

VAL What mingled pangs of relief and distress.

CAMILLE To bear her out, what relief and distress

*DANILO What jealous pangs grip my heart and oppress*

ZETA I can’t believe it, A nightmare no less.

NJEGUS A most adroit manoeuvre, all will confess.

HANNA It seems that the Baron thought it fit to spy on his friends and be indiscreet.

 So you my Camille must bravely repeat the secrets you told me so meltingly sweet.

CAMILLE Must I obey you?

*DANILO The whole truth I pray you.*

CAMILLE You see me, Baron in hopeless plight.  She has commanded her word is my law.

ZETA Can’t wait to hear what he has to say.

CAMILLE (Song)  

HANNA (Song) 

VAL, DAN & ZETA (Song)

HANNA Well there it is friends.  You know exactly what happened between us in the pavilion.  There’s no going back on that sort of thing.  And now for my trump card.. I’ve something to say.  A special announcement.

CHORUS What news?  What news?

HANNA May I present my latest Bridegroom –

CAMILLE What?  Me?

VAL Oh God!

*DANILO How sweet.*

ZETA What’s this?

HANNA And I’m the bride of course.

CHORUS And she’s the Bride of course.

VAL I’m lost.

CAMILLE I’m blowed.

*DANILO I’m damned.*

ZETA We’re sunk.

HANNA It’s having the desired effect.

CHORUS Congratulations.

*DANILO And all because of twenty millions*

ZETA A long goodbye to twenty millions.

CAMILLE I must speak up.  I can’t act any more.

HANNA You’ll bring disgrace on the girl you adore.

ZETA And you really mean this?

VAL Tell me honestly.

HANNA Why every not?

ZETA The Count and I both disapprove.

HANNA Indeed!

*DANILO No. No, believe me.  I’m enchanted ma’am.  And furthermore you have my blessing – I only said –*

HANNA You only said?

HANNA & DAN + (Song)

HANNA You do?  Then if there’s no offence, say what you please.  You’ve got an audience and I’m listening.

*DANILO I’ll begin then.*

*DANILO (Song)*

HANNA You’re going Count?  But where?

*DANILO Where?*

*DANILO (Song)*

HANNA He loves me alone.  Me Alone..  He loves me.  He loves me.

HANNA & CHORUS (song) 

## Act 3

ZETA No what’s all this?  

NJEGUS La Cabaret des Grisettes here in the garden of Madame Glawari’s mansion.

ZETA Not the genuine articles surely?

NJEGUS All authentic to the last eyelash.  The Lolas, Dodos, and Froufrous, 

NJEGUS Even Her Excellency, your good lady wife will be obliged – by your leave – to become ever so slightly Froufrou tonight.

ZETA What Njegus?  What do you mean?

NJEGUS I only mean that she will have to behave as though she were a grisette born and bred.

ZETA Her Excellency?  A grisette?  Most irregular.

NJEGUS It’s all for the cause.

ZETA Ah, the cause!  Come on then, let’s risk it.

 (Dance)

*DANILO Good heavens.  What’s all this?  Where am I? Supposed to be? Ah!*

 (Song and Dance)

*DANILO I’m flabbergasted.*  

VAL It’s just natural talent dear Count.

*DANILO You’re wasted at that stuffy old Embassy.*

*DANILO Well Njegus, I’m utterly amazed.*

NJEGUS Me too.  You could knock me down with a cork.

*DANILO But how on earth did Madame Glawari get hold of this extravagant idea?*

NJEGUS Well she said she wanted you to feel at home – in her home.

*DANILO She really said that?*

NJEGUS She said a few genuine grisettes would do the trick – and a few fairy lights.

*DANILO Oh I see.  Oh well.  But the whole Pontevedrian colony has made itself at home.  Was that part of the plan too?*

 (A Footman gives Njegus a telegram)

NJEGUS If you please your Excellency, an express telegram.

ZETA What again.....Yes from the Ministry.  Gentlemen, I must ask you to join me in an emergency meeting of the council.

*DANILO Come on then.*  

ZETA No there is no time to sit.  This is a really urgent matter.  It looks distinctly unpleasant.  Attache – decode it.

*DANILO “If Glawari millions not ours, State bankruptcy inevitable.  Stop.  Act at once.*

ZETA There’s only one way out of this.  A direct appeal to her sense of patriotism.  If she has any decent feelings at all for the Fatherland, then she will simply have to marry a Ponte+vedrian.

ALL Hear, hear.

ZETA Count Danilovitch, it’s up to you to make this appeal.  Are we agreed?

ALL Agreed.

ZETA You must find out the true nature of her feelings.  

*DANILO I’ll find out.  One thing I can tell you here and now;  if Madam Glawari marries de Rosillion I’ll enter a monastery and stay there for life.*

ZETA Bravo

 (Dance)

HANNA Please go on.

  

*DANILO Madam*

HANNA Yes?

*DANILO I have something extremely important to discuss with you.*

HANNA Won’t you be seated?

*DANILO No then; to come slowly  to the point ....I forbid you to marry de Rosillion.*

HANNA I shall tell you the reason you are forbidding me to marry Camille... because you still love me.

*DANILO I?...Really... No..no..*

 Your millions have got to remain in the country – to keep it going.

HANNA The marriage with de Rosillion is – off.

*DANILO Off?  But...but the rendezvous in the pavilion?*

HANNA I didn’t have that rendezvous – it was another woman. 

*DANILO Another woman?*

HANNA She happened to be married.  To get her out of a horrible compromising situation – I jumped into the breach.  And that, dear Count, is that.

*DANILO And you’re telling me this, only now?  You stood there letting me go black, blue and heliotrope in the face with sheer rage and misery? *

HANNA And all this that you are telling me – all this is – because?

*DANILO Yes because.........*

HANNA Why don’t you open your mouth like a man and say because...you love me.

*DANILO Anna!  It’s because....*

HANNA Yes?

*DANILO It’s because – because I love the Fatherland.*

HANNA You also go to Maximes every night – because you love the Fatherland – I suppose.

*DANILO Of course.*

HANNA Oh – you

*DANILO Yes?*

HANNA you –

*DANILO What am I?  Let’s have it at last.*

HANNA You’re – you’re – I can’t speak.

*DANILO Neither can I.*

 (Waltz – Intermezzo.  Love unspoken)

ZETA Now my friend – have you seen her?  Where do we stand?

*DANILO Madame Glawari’s marriage to de Rosillion – is off.*

ALL Bravo

ZETA Count Danilovitch, you’re a genius.  

KROMOW But, tell me if this is so, why should the lady compromise herself in such a matter?

*DANILO Aha, but Madam was not compromised at al.  She only jumped into the breach – at the last moment – to save another lady.*

ALL Another!

*DANILO Yes, a married woman of course.*

KROM. PRIT. & BROG Oh!

ZETA How interesting!  And who pray was this other woman?

NJEGUS (Fan on Silver salver)  Excellency, this fan has been found in the Pavilion.

VAL Oh that fan!

ZETA But Count Danilo, this was the fan I asked you to keep for me.

*DANILO Yes, but I lost it.*

ZETA You lost it in the pavilion, don’t you remember?  What’s this?  My wife’s handwriting.

VAL I am lost.

ZETA You’re divorced.  Madam I have the honour – in the name of the Fatherland – to ask you for the honour of your hand in marriage.

HANNA Your proposal flatters me.  But you’re doing the Fatherland no service.  I must explain that according to my late husband’s will, Codicil Number Five –

ZETA Take that down, Njegus, Codicil Number Five

HANNA It is laid down that in the event of my marrying again I should lose my whole fortune.

ZETA “Lose her whole fortune”.....What?

*DANILO Anna!  Is it true – you would have no money?  None at all?*

HANNA None at all.

*DANILO Hanna – my beloved  HAnna – I love you – I love you – I love you..*

HANNA At last.

ZETA He marries her without the money.    Where the deuce do we go from there?

HANNA It’s quite simple.  I would lose the money because it would at once become the sole property of my husband.

ZETA But dammit, this fan – this fan.

VAL Have you read what I wrote on it, my dear?  I don’t think you have.

ZETA I’m a highly respectable woman...Excuse me ....I never knew.  Darling can you ever forgive me?

*DANILO Waiter!  Champagne!*
